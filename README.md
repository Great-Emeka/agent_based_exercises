# Multi-Agent Exercise (mango Framework)

This project contains solutions to Exercise Sheet 1 for the course **Agent-based Control in Energy Systems**.  
The implementation uses the **mango** multi-agent framework built on Python's `asyncio`.

## What This Project Covers
- Creating and activating a mango **Container**
- Using a **PrintingAgent**
- Implementing custom agents that:
  - React to incoming messages
  - Keep internal state (message counters)
  - Communicate with other agents (ping-pong behavior)
- Extending agents to exchange values using the **Fibonacci sequence**
- Demonstrating **reflexive vs. deliberative agent** behavior
- Designing a small conceptual **multi-agent system** for an energy-use scenario

## Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- `mango` framework installed
- Basic understanding of `asyncio`

## Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## RUNNING THE CODE:

python -m asyncio run <script_name>.py

      python exercise1.py
      python exercise2.py
      python exercise4.py
      python exercise7.py
      python exercise9.py
(Depending on which exercise you want to test.)


## Notes

All exercises follow the lifecycle and messaging concepts defined in mango.

The example systems are conceptual and intended for learning, not production.

### Exercise 3 — Type of Agent in Exercise 2

**The agent implemented in Exercise 2 is a Reflexive (Reactive) Agent.**
It exhibits simple stimulus-response behavior where each incoming message triggers a predetermined action (increment counter and send response) based on a straightforward condition (counter < 10). It doesn't maintain complex internal state or engage in sophisticated reasoning beyond this basic reaction pattern.


**Exercise 5 — Why Agents and Containers are Separated**

In mango, agents and containers serve different roles:

**Component	Role**
- Agent	Contains behavior and decision-making logic.
- Container	Handles communication, networking, and message routing.

**The separation of Agents and Containers in the mango framework serves several important purposes:**

**- Communication Infrastructure:** Containers provide the messaging infrastructure, handling message routing, serialization, and network communication, while agents focus on business logic.

**- Resource Management:** Containers manage computational resources and provide a runtime environment for multiple agents, enabling efficient resource sharing.

**- Isolation:** Agents are isolated from low-level communication details, allowing developers to focus on agent behavior rather than networking complexities.

**- Scalability:** Multiple agents can run within a single container, and multiple containers can be distributed across different machines, supporting horizontal scaling.

**- Lifecycle Management:** Containers manage the complete agent lifecycle (creation, registration, activation, termination) in a consistent manner.

**- Interoperability:** Containers enable communication between agents running in different environments or on different networks through standardized protocols.


### Exercise 6 — Agent Lifecycle
Agent Lifecycle in mango:

1. Creation: Agent object is instantiated via constructor
  - Purpose: Initialize agent with initial state and configuration
  - Actions: Define instance variables, setup initial conditions, configure agent      properties

2. Registration: Agent is registered with a container using container.register(agent)
  - Purpose: Make agent addressable and enable message routing
  - Actions: Container learns about agent's address, agent becomes discoverable by other agents.

3. Activation: Container starts processing messages via mango.activate(container)
  - Purpose: Begin normal operation where agents can send/receive messages
  - Actions: Start message processing loops, begin scheduled tasks, enable communication

4. Message Handling: Agents process incoming messages via handle_message(content, meta)
  - Purpose: React to communication from other agents
  - Actions: Process content, update internal state, send responses using schedule_instant_message(), make decisions based on received information

5. Task Scheduling: Agents can schedule tasks using methods like schedule_instant_message()
  - Purpose: Enable proactive behavior beyond reactive message handling
  - Actions: Send messages to other agents, perform periodic actions, execute delayed tasks, initiate communications

6.  Termination: Agent is stopped when container context exits
  - Purpose: Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
  - Actions: Clean up resources, complete pending operations, save state if necessary


### Exercise 8 — Suitability of Agent Approach
Given two different problems:

There is a house with two solar panels and one energy storage; the owner solely wants to maximize the self-consumption (consumption of self-produced energy).
There are multiple houses with solar panels, and each wants to sell surplus energy to the energy market and maximize the profit. Are agents a reasonable approach to these problems? And why (or why not)?

**Problem 1 (Single house with solar panels and storage):**
Agents are less suitable for this problem. This represents a centralized optimization problem where:

All components (solar panels, storage, consumption) are physically co-located
There's a single objective (maximize self-consumption)
- The system components are tightly coupled
- A monolithic controller can efficiently manage all components with global information
- The overhead of agent communication would add unnecessary complexity
- No need for negotiation or distributed decision-making

**Problem 2 (Multiple houses selling to energy market):**
Agents are highly suitable for this problem because:

- Autonomy: Each house has individual goals (profit maximization)
- Distributed nature: Physically separate entities with local information
- Competition/Cooperation: Houses may compete or form coalitions in energy trading
- Local decision-making: Each agent knows its own generation, consumption, and preferences
- Scalability: Easy to add more houses as autonomous agents
- Adaptability: Agents can respond to changing market conditions individually
- Natural representation: Real-world scenario with multiple independent decision-makers

### Exercise 10
In the lecture, you learned about the PEAS (performance metric, environment, actuators, and sensors) description of agents. Describe every agent of your solution for Exercise 9 following the PEAS categories.

**House Agent PEAS Description:**

- Performance Metric: Profit maximization (revenue from energy sales minus cost of energy purchases), efficient utilization of self-produced energy

- Environment: Local energy generation/consumption patterns, energy market with fluctuating prices, weather conditions affecting solar production, household energy demands

- Actuators: Submit buy/sell orders to market, adjust offering prices and strategies, control local energy storage (charge/discharge), manage local energy consumption

- Sensors: Receive market price announcements, trade confirmations, monitor own solar generation, track household energy consumption, receive weather forecasts

**Market Agent PEAS Description:**

- Performance Metric: Market efficiency (successful matches between buyers and sellers), liquidity maintenance, fair price discovery, transaction volume maximization

- Environment: Collection of buy/sell orders from multiple house agents, market regulations and constraints, overall supply-demand balance, price volatility

- Actuators: Match buy/sell orders, broadcast market prices and conditions, send trade confirmations, enforce market rules, clear transactions

- Sensors: Receive energy offers and requests from house agents, monitor market conditions and liquidity, track transaction history, detect market anomalies
